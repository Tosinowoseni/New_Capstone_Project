# Notes for January 4, 2023

## Tasks to complete


Concentrate on the View:
- get used to using the `npm run dev` or `npm start` commands and going to localhost at the proper port on your local computer
- Read about using `className` on html elements in React instead of `class`
- Keep adjusting the CSS
- figure out how to change the font in the `font-family` CSS declaration for the body tag
- try to get more familiar with NextJS
-- figure out where to put the "images" folder
-- add an "about" page

## Terms to get familiar with

**Responsive Web Design** - HTML/CSS that "responds" to different or changing conditions using the HTML structure.  Most of the time this is the screen size (and most of the time the screen width is the main size looked at), but could also be based on the computer's color preferences, or features of any browser that may or may not be available.



**Adaptive Web Design** - Similar to above but using JavaScript to change the HTML structure (or the CSS but this is happens much less)

**Progressive Enhancement** - the practice of using advanced features of a given platform (in our case, a web browser), but having reasonalble defaults or fallbacks for users who cannot yet use the advanced features.
