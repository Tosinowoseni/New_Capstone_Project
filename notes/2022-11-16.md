# Notes for Nov 16, 2022

## Tasks to complete


Concentrate on the View:

- Replicate Macy's Home Page in HTML and CSS. This will help us later think about how to break down an application in pieces

## Topics to Research

**Markdown**


Markdown is what this document is "coded" with. It's output is similar to HTML but with no tags as you can see.

## Terms to get familiar with
(don't just take my experiment)

**Client** - Something that recieves data, like a web browser


**Server** - something that serves data



**Library** - A small set of tools or utilties that tend to come as a package.  Examples:
- jQuery
- Lodash (www.lodash.com)
- React / ReactDOM are both kind of a library and kind of a framework at the same time
- Most NPM packages or python modules are library

**Framework**
A framework is like a library but adds "scaffolding" to your application.  It basically helps set up differnt parts of an application like views, data fetching, and data flow, for example


examples:
- Django (a framework for Python web applications)
- ExpressJS (a fraomework for JavaScript applications)



**MetaFrameworks**
Basically a Framework on top of a library or another framework

examples:
- NextJS
