I want to create an ecommerce web application that
serves to the fashion industry. I want to create a
Fashion web applictaion that has a mens page, womens
page, kids page, and display skin care products. I also want it to display a check in and out shopping cart and login in and out buttons. I wanrt it to be fully interactive and functional

_Do you want it to use real data? Do you want to start off slow and ramp up? Put the vision in your words._

it doesn't have to use real data but I want it to be very creative and colorful. I wanrt it to look like an actual fashion website or online clothing store.
## What parts of it do you want to work on
- Front end?
  - JavaScript / Interactions?
  - HTML / CSS
  - Frameworks and Libraries like React (using NextJS or Remix)
- backend end?
  - Database?
  - Login / Logout?
  - Serving the site from a local server?

- All JavaScript or Python and JavaScript?

I want to focus more on the Front end part of this application. I want this application  to consist of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I want to use React for my Framework using NextJS and for my Back end, I want to use Python and MYSQL, and we can use Django framework, I also want Postman for my API and login / logout.
